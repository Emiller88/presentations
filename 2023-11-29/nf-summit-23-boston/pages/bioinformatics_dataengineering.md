## Bioinformaticians love files

- From a time where the data was bigger than the memory in the computer
<!-- TODO Check spelling -->
- Mor's law caught up
  - Tools are starting to take advantage of widely available compute
  <!-- TODO Confirm it loads the whole reference into memory -->

## Medalion architecture

- Bronze = samtools<sub>stats.txt</sub>
- Silver = multiqc<sub>samtools</sub><sub>stats.txt</sub>
- Gold = ???

## Perks

- We can have our files, and do our analysis too
<!-- Maybe? -->
- We can skip over the part where we pay a vendor tons of money to keep our data "hot"
