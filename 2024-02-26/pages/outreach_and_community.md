# Training and Documentation overhaul

- Training and docs are a bit scattered over years
- Targeted training (Quick start, afternoon intro, multiple days of training)
- Differentiation between developers and users
  - Theme of too many users, not enough developers
- Added `Vale` for automated prose linting to the docs(and Spell checking)

<!--
Need a cohesive message to users

# Publication of a nf-core v2.0 paper

- It's been 4 years since the first nf-core paper
- Important for academic funding and justification
- Was originally going to be the Euro-FAANG paper but 3/4ths of it was all of the nf-core improvements over the past 4 years...

# nf-core mentorship program

- Half of the last mentorship program were volunteers that selected their mentee
- Saw a lot of output from those
- Prospective mentors can set more targeted aims
- Community members can apply to be a mentee of (a) specific mentor(s)

# Open office hours for nf-core developers

- Sitting on Zoom/Gathertown for an hour on Fridays
- Not training or support
- PR reviews, discuss issues
- Hoping to lift up more members in the community

# nf-core pyramid

- Proper proportions of users to people maintaining the software

# Flattening of the pyramid

- Issue isn't that there's too many users
- Not enough guidance for new community members to be lifted up
- Disproportionate amount of work requested to work being picked up
- Hoping to address through multiple initiatives:
  - Improved training
  - Mentorship program
  - Office hours
