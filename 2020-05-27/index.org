*** Getting started
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Install Nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
# Add Nextflow binary to your user's PATH:
mv nextflow ~/bin/

nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile docker \
    --singleEnd --reads '*.fastq' --genome GRCm38

nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -profile utd_ganymede \

** [[https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/deepsea/][DeepSEA]]
DeepSEA is a deep learning-based algorithmic framework for predicting the
chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single nucleotide sensitivity.
** Overview
- Trying to solve the issue of creating new deep learning architectures and
  training them on new data sets.
- Created to be a framework to be easy to use for deep learning in biology.
** Case 1: Training an exisiting architecture on a different dataset
- Trains DeepSEA module for transcription factor GATA1
- Zero lines of python code
** Case 2: Developing a new architecture and comparing performance across architectures
- Allows use of PyTorch modules
- Fully compatible with [[https://kipoi.org/][Kipoi]]
- Focus is on experimenting with various models rather than repeating code for
  training and evaluation.
** Case 3: Applying a new model to variants
- They train the new model from Case 2 to be used on the Alzheimer's disease
  GWAS to find varent effects that are significant and non-significant.
** Online methods
- Has an SDK and a CLI
- SDK is a python package for use in example with a web app to allow researchers
  to submit sequences.
