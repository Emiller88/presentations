* GRO-Seq Analysis
** IMR90
*** Overview of Project for new Members
- Compared IMR90 Predicted Enhancers to GM
- Ran GREAT Analysis on them
- Began working to find coverage of eRNAs in Samples

*** GREAT IMR90 Unique
      - lung vasculature development
      - growth factor receptor binding
      - tissue remodeling
      - positive regulation of endothelial cell migration
      - embryonic skeletal joint development
*** GREAT IMR90 and GM Overlap
      - 643(~30%) Transcripts were -500 to -50 from TSS
      - 1002(80%) Were Associated with 2 genes per region
      - 104(10%) were associated with 1 gene
      - Notable Biological processes:
        - cytokine secretion
        - cytokine production
        - regulation of immune response
        - immune effector process
        - regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress
*** Coverage of eRNAs in Samples
- Issue with lack of output
- Cause is most likely file types
*** Snakemake IMR90

*** Trying to Reproduce GM
**** hg18 vs hg19
**** Overpredicting eRNA transcripts
*** Organize tasks
