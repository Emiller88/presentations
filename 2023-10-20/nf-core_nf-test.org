* TODO Add nf-core logo inside of the nf-test logo :noexport:
* TODO Add in gregors custom version checker :noexport:
Make sure mahesh didn't also work on it
* Abstract :noexport:

The nf-core community values results. One of the most important steps in
producing accurate analyses is incorporating reproducible and scalable testing
within your workflows. First weâ€™ll reflect on the beginning of testing at
nf-core, then dive into the evolution of testing starting with the need for a
testing framework, examine the introduction of modules, and understand the
adoption of pytest-workflow. Next, weâ€™ll go over how nf-test has been amazing
for testing full pipelines, their subworkflows and local modules. Weâ€™ll examine
some highlights such as snapshots, tags and the CI configuration. Finally, weâ€™ll
talk about nf-core modules, and the necessity to support legacy pytest-workflow
tests as we transition to nf-test. Weâ€™ll also go over the progress made during
the hackathon on nf-test.

** Why Am I giving this talk :noexport:

# TODO Insert Spider man meme of Adam and Sateesh saying their the nf-test guru

# I think I got to give this talk because everyone else involved had something
# more important to present. These talks are tough to prepare for ahead of time
# because you're waiting for the hackathon to finish so you know what you can
# present
** Why does everyone keep talking about testing?

#+beamer: \pause
- Testing data pipelines is hard
#+beamer: \pause
- We really just want the bear-minimum, *confidence in our results*
#+beamer: \pause
- Bioinformatics software is finicky

- As you can see, a lot of complexity and HUGE barrier to entry
- Time consuming and collecting files, and hashes by hand or writing scripts


** Somethings we learned along the way

- Checking what code has changed and only running tests for that code
  - /Speed/ - Saves developer time
  - GitHub runners are a finite resource
- Conda hates checksums
- Investing time in testing *pays off in the long run*

* nf-test Features we love
** Simple Nextflow style one-line install

\large
#+begin_src bash
curl -fsSL https://code.askimed.com/install/nf-test | bash
#+end_src

** Native support for Nextflow

#+begin_src bash
nf-test test pipeline.nf.test --profile test,docker
#+end_src

** Testing Nextflow all the way down

#+begin_src bash
# Create a test cases for all processes in folder modules:
nf-test generate process modules/**/*.nf
# Create a test case for a subworkflow:
nf-test generate workflow workflows/some_workflow.nf
# Create a test case for the whole pipeline:
nf-test generate pipeline main.nf
# Create a test case for each function in file functions.nf:
nf-test generate function functions.nf
#+end_src

** Snapshot generation

#+begin_src nextflow
assert snapshot(
    workflow,
    path("${params.outdir}/file1.txt"),
    path("${params.outdir}/file2.txt"),
    path("${params.outdir}/file3.txt")

** Powerful assertions - GZip files

#+begin_src bash
assert path(process.out.out_ch.get(0)).linesGzip.size() == 5
assert path(process.out.out_ch.get(0)).linesGzip.contains("Line Content")
#+end_src

** Powerful assertions - Fasta files (and Plugins!)

#+begin_src bash
assert path('path/to/fasta1.fasta').fasta == path("path/to/fasta2.fasta'").fasta
# Work with individual samples
def sequences = path('path/to/fasta1.fasta.gz').fasta

* nf-test in nf-test/modules

** nf-test in modules

- Only running CI on code that changed
- Splitting up jobs to run on separate runners

** Modules has a ton of activity :ATTACH:

** Â¿Porque No Los Dos? :ATTACH:

[[attachment:modules_nftest_workflow.png]]

** Pre-hackathon

- 2 modules(fastqc and snakemake)
- Still supporting pytest-workflow
- Only running tests on changed code

** Future

- 59 modules and subworkflows tested
- Module maintainers with automated review requests
- Automated package version updates

** IDEA Abstract :noexport:

Finally, we'll jump into nf-core modules, and how we couldn't just rip out
pytest-workflow. We'll briefly go over the ability to have both testing
frameworks available in the repo. Then we'll talk about the few issues holding
back the overall adoption of nf-test because of some bad habits we picked up
from pytest-workflow.

Hopefully then we'll get to take a quick victory lap for all of the modules we
converted over to nf-test during the hackathon
* nf-test in pipelines

** nf-core Introduction

- Nextflow pipelines with a twist
#+beamer: \pause
- Run on /everything/
#+beamer: \pause
- Supported by *template updates* when new version releases of nf-core/tools that
  usually add *new features*
#+beamer: \pause
  + These new features sometimes come with unintended bugs!
#+beamer: \pause
- Supported by pull-requests from the community
#+beamer: \pause
  - But how do we have confidence in code from new contributors?

** Why test pipelines? :noexport:

- Avoid Regressions
- Improve confidence in scientific outcomes
- Confidence in collaboration across the world

** Where are we?

- Added in Methylseq in version ~2.4.0~
- Pre-hackathon: 7 pipelines
#+beamer: \pause
# ðŸŽ‰
- Post-hackathon: _11_ pipelines

*** Pipelines :noexport:

** nf-test scatter

# https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/issues/102

- Typically software tests are ran in parallel
#+beamer: \pause
- Usually each test doesn't take 5 minutes...
#+beamer: \pause
- Think GitHub actions batch

** Where are we going?

- Lock down the nf-core nf-test standard(where do the tests live?)
- Add nf-test to the template
- Add test generation into ~nf-core <modules/subworkflows> create~
  
** Conclusion

#+beamer: \pause

** IDEA Abstract :noexport:
Next, we'll go over how nf-test has been amazing for testing full pipelines,
their subworkflows and local modules. We'll examine some highlights such as
snapshots, tags and the CI configuration.

- We could never use pytest-workflow for testing pipelines(Expect Sarek)
- We'll mainly focus on the CI infrastructure, and configuration of these tests
  and how we parallelized the testing of the workflows.
