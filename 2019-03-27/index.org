* GRO-Seq Analysis
** Recap
- Predicted IMR90 eRNAs
- Compared IMR90 Predicted Enhancers to GM
- Ran GREAT Analysis on them
- Used Homer builtin scripts to find DE of eRNAs and Genes
** What I've been working on
*** Gene Centric vs. Enhancer Centric
- Peng's approach
  - Took enhancers that were expressed deferentially
  - Linked them to Genes within 200Kb
- New approach
  - Take genes that are deferentially expressed
  - Link the Enhancers to those genes
*** Gene Differenitial Expression

*** featureCounts
**** Tried CLI version
**** Couldn't get examples to work with edgeR
**** Switched to R package
*** edgeR
**** Error with exactTest
**** Defaulted to writing raw DGEList to file
**** Used in Pivot
** Results

**** Compare IMR and GM Genes
**** Get List of Top Genes
**** Link eRNAs and Top genes
**** Kinetics of the eRNAs
